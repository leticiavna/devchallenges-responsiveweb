## Overview

This was a quick challenge; I added some JS to get the cart buttons working and the after submit toast appearing, accordingly to form validation. I used the `checkValidity` function to make the toast function.

This was also a challenge to style the inputs: I had to add a custom arrow to the select input and style the placeholders. The custom arrow is from Material Icons: the code from it is added to the `content` property on the `:after` pseudoelement.
