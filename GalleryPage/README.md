## Overview

I took this challenge as an opportunity to use Netlify to deploy. It sure is a complete platform for much more complex projects, but it was a nice way to discover it and learn how to use it.

This was also an opportunity to explore more the CSS grid: I relied heavily on `grid-template` and `grid-area` to build this. Since this was a static project, I could specify exaclty what i wanted in each area of the layout and adjust the layout based on this. If this was a project that would show up a unknown N number of images, this would have to be worked on a little more!

Another concept that I could learn from this is the Mansory Layout: when items have different width and heights and should be displayed in such a way that it looks like a board (kind of like Pinterest layout). This is the concept that this project uses and it was interesting because all the images had different sizes.
