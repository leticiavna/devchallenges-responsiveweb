## Overview

For this challenge I wanted to create specific classes (presets) to use in all texts. I thought this would be easier to manage since there was a lot of different styles inside the project. I also got to play around with the aside tag and it's responsive layout.

The most challenging part (also, the most fun) was styling the checkboxes and the numbered list (marker). I wanted to style the browser styles so I used the `::before`, `::after`, `::marker`, `:checked` pseudoclasses/elements. Had no idea it was a more complicated work, so i really enjoyed doing it :sparkles:
